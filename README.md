# Labs

  Many css style choices came from things I learned on my own over winter break last year for my personal website.This inclues the transition I added on hover on our homepage. Along with the use of sections and box-sizing: border-box, which includes padding and margin in the width and height for sizing.

  I used this for my skills portion of my resume:

  I used w33 schools for general syntax refreshers:

  The major thing I got stuck on for this lab was css. I knew what I wanted in my head, but often times it took a very long time for myself to reach that destination. I specifically got stuck in situations like on my resume where I wanted sections to be side by side. And I also wanted my photo to be side by side with my vcard within a section. This took a lot of referencing back to my personal website, where I spent a lot of time learning about flexbox and grid. I still have a long way to go, and hope to be able to put what I invision onto the page a lot faster than I can now. I also hope to be able to understand more about how to adapt page styles as screen-sizes change. Another spot our group struggled with was GIThub, especially different branches and merging those branches. I am looking forward to our lecture on Github, so groupwork like this can be a lot more efficient in the future.

I worked on my resume page, the logo, and Slogan. It took me some time doing the css because I struggled remembering what I learned in intro. I looked at https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp for help. I also looked at https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp to center my resume image. I looked at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/microformats to learn microformats.
