  Many css style choices came from things I learned on my own over winter break last year for my personal website.This inclues the transition I added on hover on our homepage. Along with the use of sections and box-sizing: border-box, which includes padding and margin in the width and height for sizing.

  I used this for my skills portion of my resume:

  I used w33 schools for general syntax refreshers:

  The major thing I got stuck on for this lab was css. I knew what I wanted in my head, but often times it took a very long time for myself to reach that destination. I specifically got stuck in situations like on my resume where I wanted sections to be side by side. And I also wanted my photo to be side by side with my vcard within a section. This took a lot of referencing back to my personal website, where I spent a lot of time learning about flexbox and grid. I still have a long way to go, and hope to be able to put what I invision onto the page a lot faster than I can now. I also hope to be able to understand more about how to adapt page styles as screen-sizes change. Another spot our group struggled with was GIThub, especially different branches and merging those branches. I am looking forward to our lecture on Github, so groupwork like this can be a lot more efficient in the future.

I worked on my resume page, the logo, and Slogan. It took me some time doing the css because I struggled remembering what I learned in intro. I looked at https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp for help. I also looked at https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp to center my resume image. I looked at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/microformats to learn microformats.

In this lab, I helped make the UI design for the homepage. I wanted to make sure that all of our profile pictures were included and that each picture would take the user to each of our resume page, when one of our picures was clicked. As for my resume page, I wanted to make sure that it was in the same format as my actual resume, so I decided to apply all of the tags I learned in my Intro to ITWS class. Those tags included ul, li, p tags, etc. I used those li tags to make sure that there were bullet points just like my actual resume. I tried to avoid using too many div tags, that is why I used class to make sure I grouped certain lines of my resume, that I wanted to be in bold or italicized in my css. For my css, I made sure that my lines used #jasmine, so that my css style only applied to my resume page.  I also used these links to recall my memory on how to use hyperlinks,how to center images with css, and how to create a full background page. :
