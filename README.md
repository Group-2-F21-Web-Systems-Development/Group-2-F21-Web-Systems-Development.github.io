  Many css style choices came from things I learned on my own over winter break last year for my personal website.This inclues the transition I added on hover on our homepage. Along with the use of sections and box-sizing: border-box, which includes padding and margin in the width and height for sizing.

  I used this for my skills portion of my resume:

  I used w33 schools for general syntax refreshers:
