  Many css style choices came from things I learned on my own over winter break last year for my personal website.This inclues the transition I added on hover on our homepage. Along with the use of sections and box-sizing: border-box, which includes padding and margin in the width and height for sizing.

  I used this for my skills portion of my resume:

  I used w33 schools for general syntax refreshers:

I worked on my resume page, the logo, and Slogan. It took me some time doing the css because I struggled remembering what I learned in intro. I looked at https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp for help. I also looked at https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp to center my resume image. I looked at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/microformats to learn microformats.
